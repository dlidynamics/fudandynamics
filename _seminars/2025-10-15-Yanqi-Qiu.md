abstract: >
  I will review our recent processes on Fourier decay of random measures arising from Kahane's T-martingale theory, including Mandelbrot Cascades (canonical or microcanonical), Gaussian Multiplicative Chaos, Random Coverings and more abstract ones. If time allows, I shall also mention some more recent work on a class of new critical multiplicative chaos random measures. The talk is based on a series of joint works with Xinxin Chen, Yong Han, Zipeng Wang, and  with Zhaofeng Lin, Mingjie Tan, as well as with Yukun Chen, Zhaofeng Lin, and with Ma Heng, Yushu Zheng.
