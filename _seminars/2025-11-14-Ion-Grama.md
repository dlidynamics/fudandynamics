abstract:  "We study a real-valued random walk with centered increments and a finite (2+delta)-moment. Using a previously established approximation of the Gaussian heat kernel for persistence probabilities, we prove a new local limit theorem conditioned by the exit time from the half-line. This result unifies and generalizes existing theorems and provides uniform asymptotics with respect to both the starting and ending points.  "
