abstract: > In the divergence case of Khintchine’s theorem, Schmidt 
obtained an asymptotic formula for the number of rational approximations 
of bounded height to almost every real number. We prove a version of 
this result for intrinsic Diophantine approximation on Grassmannians. 
The proof relies on an L^{1+\epsilon}-integrability property of a Siegel 
transform naturally associated with the Grassmannian, together with the 
effective single and double equidistribution property of translated 
orbits of maximal compact subgroups, results of independent interest.
