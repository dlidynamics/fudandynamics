abstract: >
  Motivated by the work of Besson-Courois-Gallot, we define a gradient flow using the Patterson-Sullivan theory. We show the flow has certain volume contracting properties if the critical exponent is small enough. This leads to many applications in geometry and topology. Finally, we will mention a related subexponential growth condition on the Patterson-Sullivan measures and how this condition connects to the finiteness of the Bowen-Margulis measure in certain cases. This is joint work with Chris Connell and Ben McReynolds.
