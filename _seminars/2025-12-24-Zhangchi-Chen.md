  "The existence of wandering domains is an interesting research topic in higher-dimensional complex dynamics, and also an essential difference between higher-dimensional polynomial dynamical systems and the one-dimensional case.

  Using a positive integer sequence with exponential growth, A-B constructed a polynomial skew product map P in C^2 admitting wandering domains. Two biholomorphic invariants (real numbers) α,β (with α>1) can be defined by the coefficients of P. A-B proved that for given (α,β), if there exists a positive integer sequence (n_k) such that the phase sequence σ_k:=n_{k+1}-α*n_k-β*ln n_k converges, then P has wandering domains.

  This raises the question: For which (α,β) does there exist such a sequence (n_k) making (t_k) converge?

  A-B showed that α must be a Pisot number. They also gave a condition for β : if θ=(β*ln α)/(α-1) is rational, then there exists a positive integer sequence (n_k) such that (σ_k) converges to a periodic point. They posed the question: Is the rationality of θ a necessary condition?

  In collaboration with Zihao Ye, we gave an affirmative answer to the A-B problem when a is an algebraic number.

  Furthermore, we studied the conditions for the existence of a positive integer sequence (n_k) such that (σ_k) converges. Suppose α is an algebraic number with minimal polynomial P(x), then P(1)*θ being integer is a necessary condition, and P(1)*θ/(gcd(P(1),P'(1)) being integer is a sufficient condition.

  As an application in dynamical systems, we constructed new polynomial skew product maps with wandering domains."
