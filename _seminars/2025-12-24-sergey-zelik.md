"We discuss the classical and recent results in the theory of  IMs including the classical spectral gap conditions; the non-existence results for the case where these conditions are violated; some methods how they can be overcome in some interesting particular cases; etc. The smoothness of IMs as well as open problems of the theory will be also discussed."
